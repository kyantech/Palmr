Welcome to the fastest way to deploy <span className="font-bold">Palmr.</span> - your secure, self-hosted file sharing solution. This guide will have you up and running in minutes, whether you're new to self-hosting or an experienced developer.

Palmr. offers flexible deployment options to match your infrastructure needs. This guide focuses on Docker deployment with our recommended filesystem storage, perfect for most use cases.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker** - Container runtime ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))

> **Platform Support**: Palmr. is developed on macOS and extensively tested on Linux servers. While we haven't formally tested other platforms, Docker's cross-platform nature should ensure compatibility. Report any issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr/issues).

## Storage Options

Palmr. supports two storage approaches for persistent data:

### Named Volumes (Recommended)

**Best for**: Production environments, automated deployments

- ✅ **Managed by Docker**: No permission issues or manual path management
- ✅ **Optimized Performance**: Docker-native storage optimization
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Consistent behavior across operating systems
- ✅ **Simplified Backups**: Docker volume commands for backup/restore

### Bind Mounts

**Best for**: Development, direct file access requirements

- ✅ **Direct Access**: Files stored in local directory you specify
- ✅ **Transparent Storage**: Direct filesystem access from host
- ✅ **Custom Backup**: Use existing file system backup solutions
- ⚠️ **Permission Considerations**: **Common Issue** - Requires UID/GID configuration (see troubleshooting below)

---

## Option 1: Named Volumes (Recommended)

Named volumes provide the best performance and are managed entirely by Docker.

### Configuration

Use the provided `docker-compose.yaml` for named volumes:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - ENABLE_S3=false
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-this-key-in-production-min-32-chars # CHANGE THIS KEY FOR SECURITY
      # - SECURE_SITE=false # Set to true if you are using a reverse proxy
    ports:
      - "5487:5487" # Web interface
      - "3333:3333" # API port (OPTIONAL EXPOSED - ONLY IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS THE API DIRECTLY)
    volumes:
      - palmr_data:/app/server # Named volume for the application data
    restart: unless-stopped # Restart the container unless it is stopped

volumes:
  palmr_data:
```

> **Note:** If you haveing problem with uploading files, try to change the `PALMR_UID` and `PALMR_GID` to the UID and GID of the user running the container. You can find the UID and GID of the user running the container with the command `id -u` and `id -g`. in Linux systems the default user is `1000` and the default group is `1000`. For test you can add the environment variables below to the `docker-compose.yaml` file and restart the container.

```yaml
environment:
  - PALMR_UID=1000 # UID for the container processes (default is 1001)
  - PALMR_GID=1000 # GID for the container processes (default is 1001)
```

> **Note:** For more information about UID and GID, see our [UID/GID Configuration](/docs/3.1-beta/uid-gid-configuration) guide.

### Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Option 2: Bind Mounts

Bind mounts store data in a local directory, providing direct file system access.

### Configuration

To use bind mounts, **replace the content** of your `docker-compose.yaml` with the following configuration (you can also reference `docker-compose-bind-mount-example.yaml` as a template):

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - ENABLE_S3=false
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY=change-this-key-in-production-min-32-chars # CHANGE THIS KEY FOR SECURITY
      # - SECURE_SITE=false # Set to true if you are using a reverse proxy
      - PALMR_UID=1000 # UID for the container processes (default is 1001)
      - PALMR_GID=1000 # GID for the container processes (default is 1001)
    ports:
      - "5487:5487" # Web port
      - "3333:3333" # API port (OPTIONAL EXPOSED - ONLY IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS THE API DIRECTLY)
    volumes:
      # Bind mount for persistent data (uploads, database, temp files)
      - ./data:/app/server # Local directory for the application data
    restart: unless-stopped # Restart the container unless it is stopped
```

### Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> **Permission Configuration**: If you encounter permission issues with bind mounts (common on NAS systems), see our [UID/GID Configuration](/docs/3.1-beta/uid-gid-configuration) guide for automatic permission handling.

## Environment Variables

Configure Palmr. behavior through environment variables:

| Variable         | Default | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENABLE_S3`      | `false` | Enable S3-compatible storage                            |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | -       | **Required**: Minimum 32 characters for file encryption |
| `SECURE_SITE`    | `false` | Enable secure cookies for HTTPS/reverse proxy setups    |

> **⚠️ Security Warning**: Always change the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in production. This key encrypts your files - losing it makes files permanently inaccessible.

> **🔗 Reverse Proxy**: If deploying behind a reverse proxy (Traefik, Nginx, etc.), set `SECURE_SITE=true` and review our [Reverse Proxy Configuration](/docs/3.1-beta/reverse-proxy-configuration) guide for proper setup.

### Generate Secure Encryption Keys

Need a strong key for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`? Use our built-in generator to create cryptographically secure keys:

## Accessing Palmr.

Once deployed, access Palmr. through your web browser:

- **Local**: `http://localhost:5487`
- **Server**: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5487`

### API Access (Optional)

If you exposed port 3333 in your configuration, you can also access:

- **API Documentation**: `http://localhost:3333/docs` (local) or `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3333/docs` (server)
- **API Endpoints**: Available at `http://localhost:3333` (local) or `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3333` (server)

> **📚 Learn More**: For complete API documentation, authentication, and integration examples, see our [API Reference](/docs/3.1-beta/api) guide.

> **💡 Production Tip**: For production deployments, configure HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate for enhanced security.

## Docker CLI Alternative

Prefer using Docker directly? Both storage options are supported:

**Named Volume:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name palmr \
  -e ENABLE_S3=false \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-key-min-32-chars \
  -p 5487:5487 \
  -p 3333:3333 \
  -v palmr_data:/app/server \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  kyantech/palmr:latest
```

**Bind Mount:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name palmr \
  -e ENABLE_S3=false \
  -e ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-key-min-32-chars \
  -p 5487:5487 \
  -p 3333:3333 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/server \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  kyantech/palmr:latest
```

---

## Maintenance

### Updates

Keep Palmr. current with the latest features and security fixes:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

### Backup & Restore

The backup method depends on which storage option you're using:

**Named Volume Backup:**

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v palmr_data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/palmr-backup.tar.gz -C /data .
```

**Named Volume Restore:**

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v palmr_data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/backup \
  alpine tar xzf /backup/palmr-backup.tar.gz -C /data
```

**Bind Mount Backup:**

```bash
tar czf palmr-backup.tar.gz ./data
```

**Bind Mount Restore:**

```bash
tar xzf palmr-backup.tar.gz
```
