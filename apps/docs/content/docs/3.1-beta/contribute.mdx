- Submit pull requests to propose changes
- Interact with other contributors and maintainers
- Track issues and participate in discussions
- Build your open-source portfolio

### Security recommendations

When creating your account:

- Use a professional email address for your GitHub account
- Enable two-factor authentication for enhanced security
- Customize your profile to showcase your interests and skills

## Accessing the repository

Once you're logged into your GitHub account, you'll need to navigate to the Palmr repository to begin your contribution journey.

### Direct access

Visit the Palmr repository directly: [https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr](https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr)

The repository contains all the source code, documentation, and resources for the Palmr project. Take time to explore the repository structure, including the README file, which provides an overview of the project.

### Alternative access methods

You can also find the repository by:

- Searching for "Palmr" in the GitHub search bar
- Looking for the repository owned by **kyantech**
- Accessing it through Kyantech's organization page

### Repository verification

When searching, ensure you're accessing the official repository by:

- Checking the owner and repository name match exactly
- Verifying the description matches the Palmr project
- Confirming recent activity from the maintainers
- Reviewing the number of stars, forks, and watchers

---

## Forking the repository

To contribute to the project, you'll need to create your own copy of the repository. This process is called **forking** and is fundamental to the GitHub collaboration workflow.

### Creating your fork

Here's how to fork the repository:

1. **Locate the Fork Button**: Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page
2. **Select Destination**: Choose where you want to fork the repository (your personal account or an organization)
3. **Wait for Creation**: Allow a few moments while GitHub creates your fork
4. **Automatic Redirect**: You'll be redirected to your forked repository once it's ready

### Fork benefits

Your fork will maintain a connection to the original repository, allowing you to:

- Keep your fork synchronized with the original repository
- Submit pull requests from your fork to the original repository
- Work independently on your own copy without affecting the original
- Experiment with changes before proposing them

---

## Cloning your fork

After forking the repository, you'll need to clone it to your local machine to begin making changes.

### Clone process

Follow these steps to clone your forked repository:

1. **Access Clone Options**: On your forked repository page, click the **Code** button
2. **Copy Repository URL**: Copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH, depending on your preference)
3. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt
4. **Execute Clone Command**: Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

5. **Navigate to Directory**: Move into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd Palmr
   ```

### Clone verification

After cloning, verify your setup by:

- Confirming all files are present in your local directory
- Checking that you can access the project files
- Testing that Git is properly configured for the repository

---

## Setting up the base branch

Before making changes, ensure your local repository is properly configured to track the correct branch from the original Palmr repository.

### Remote configuration

Set up your repository to track the upstream repository:

1. **Add Upstream Remote**: Add the original Palmr repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr.git
   ```

2. **Fetch Latest Changes**: Retrieve the latest changes from the `next` branch:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream next
   ```

3. **Create Feature Branch**: Create a new branch for your contribution based on `upstream/next`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name upstream/next
   ```

### Branch naming conventions

When creating your branch, use descriptive names that indicate the purpose of your changes:

- `feature/user-authentication` for new features
- `fix/login-bug` for bug fixes
- `docs/api-documentation` for documentation updates
- `refactor/database-queries` for code improvements

---

## Making your changes

Now you're ready to implement your contributions! This is where your creativity and technical skills come into play.

### Types of contributions

Your contributions could include:

- **Bug Fixes**: Resolving issues and improving stability
- **New Features**: Adding functionality that enhances the project

- **Testing**: Writing or improving test coverage
- **Performance**: Optimizing code for better efficiency
- **Accessibility**: Making the project more inclusive
- **Translations**: Adding support for different languages
- **Code Quality**: Refactoring and improving code structure

### Development best practices

When making changes, follow these guidelines:

1. **Follow Style Guidelines**: Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards
2. **Test Incrementally**: Run tests locally to catch issues early
3. **Keep Changes Focused**: Address a single issue or feature per contribution
4. **Document Changes**: Update or add documentation as needed
5. **Review Your Work**: Double-check changes before committing

### Development workflow

Maintain a productive workflow by:

- Regularly saving your work and committing small, logical changes
- Testing your changes incrementally to identify issues quickly
- Keeping your branch updated with the latest upstream changes
- Seeking feedback early if you're unsure about your approach

## Using conventional commits

Once you've made your changes, commit them using **Conventional Commits** format. This standard helps maintain a clean and consistent commit history that's easy to understand and automate.

### Commit message format

Structure your commit messages as follows:

`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

### Commit types and examples

**Common commit types:**

- `feat: add user authentication system`
- `fix(api): resolve null pointer exception in user service`
- `docs: update installation instructions in README`
- `test: add unit tests for user validation`
- `refactor: simplify database connection logic`
- `style: fix code formatting in auth module`
- `chore: update project dependencies`

### Committing your changes

Follow these steps to commit your work:

1. **Stage Changes**: Add your changes to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit with Message**: Create a commit with a properly formatted message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature for user profiles"
   ```

### Commit best practices

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use the imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Include additional details in the body if necessary

---

## Pushing your changes

After committing your changes locally, you need to push them to your forked repository on GitHub to make them available for review.

### Push process

Synchronize your local changes with your remote repository:

1. **Check for Updates**: Ensure your branch is current with any remote changes:

   ```bash
   git pull origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. **Push Commits**: Upload your commits to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Set Upstream** (first push only): If this is your first push for this branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin your-branch-name
   ```

### Troubleshooting push issues

If you encounter errors while pushing:

- Verify you have the correct permissions on your fork
- Check your remote URL configuration using `git remote -v`
- Ensure you're authenticated with GitHub properly
- Confirm your branch name matches what you're trying to push

## Creating a pull request

With your changes pushed to GitHub, you can now create a **Pull Request (PR)** to propose your changes to the main Palmr repository.

### Pull request setup

Create your pull request by following these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Fork**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. **Initiate PR**: Click the **Pull Request** button or **Compare & pull request** if available
3. **Configure PR Settings**: On the PR creation page, set:
   - **Base repository**: `kyantech/Palmr`
   - **Base branch**: `next`
   - **Head repository**: Your forked repository
   - **Compare branch**: Your feature branch (`your-branch-name`)
