Configure user and group permissions for seamless bind mount compatibility across different host systems, particularly NAS environments.

## Overview

Palmr. supports runtime UID/GID configuration to resolve permission conflicts when using bind mounts. This eliminates the need for manual permission management on your host system.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Palmr uses **UID 1000, GID 1000** by default, which matches the standard Linux convention. However, some systems may use different UID/GID values, which can cause permission issues with bind mounts.

## The Permission Problem

### Why This Happens

- **Palmr Default**: UID 1000, GID 1000 (container)
- **Linux Standard**: UID 1000, GID 1000 (most host systems)
- **Result**: Usually compatible, but some systems may use different values

### Common Error Scenarios

```bash
# When you see errors like:
EACCES: permission denied, open '/app/server/uploads/file.txt'
```

```bash
# Or when checking permissions:
$ ls -la uploads/
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan 15 10:00 uploads/
# Container tries to write with different UID/GID than directory owner
```

## Quick Fix

### Option 1: Set Palmr to Use Standard UID/GID (Recommended)

Add these environment variables to your `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - PALMR_UID=1000
      - PALMR_GID=1000
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/app/server/uploads:rw
      - ./temp-uploads:/app/server/temp-uploads:rw
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Option 2: Change Host Directory Permissions

If you prefer to keep Palmr's defaults:

```bash
# Create directories with correct ownership
mkdir -p uploads temp-uploads
chown -R 1001:1001 uploads temp-uploads
```

## Environment Variables

Configure permissions using these optional environment variables:

| Variable    | Description                      | Default | Example |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `PALMR_UID` | User ID for container processes  | `1001`  | `1000`  |
| `PALMR_GID` | Group ID for container processes | `1001`  | `1000`  |

---

## Finding Your Host UID/GID

Determine your host system's user and group IDs:

```bash
# Check current user
id

# Output example
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(group) groups=1000(group),27(sudo)
```

Use the `uid` and `gid` values for your `PALMR_UID` and `PALMR_GID` configuration.

## Configuration Examples

### Standard Linux System (Most Common)

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - PALMR_UID=1000
      - PALMR_GID=1000
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/server
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Synology NAS

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - PALMR_UID=1026
      - PALMR_GID=100
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - /volume1/docker/palmr:/app/server
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### QNAP NAS

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    image: kyantech/palmr:latest
    container_name: palmr
    environment:
      - PALMR_UID=1000
      - PALMR_GID=100
    ports:
      - "5487:5487"
    volumes:
      - /share/Container/palmr:/app/server
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Permission Errors

**Error**: `EACCES: permission denied`

```bash
# 1. Check your current UID/GID
id

# 2. Check directory ownership
ls -la uploads/ temp-uploads/

# 3. Fix via environment variables (preferred)
# Add to docker-compose.yaml:
# - PALMR_UID=1000
# - PALMR_GID=1000

# 4. Or fix via chown (alternative)
chown -R 1001:1001 uploads temp-uploads
```

**Error**: Container starts but files aren't accessible

```bash
# Check container's UID/GID configuration
docker-compose logs palmr | grep -E "üîß|Runtime UID/GID"

# Check file ownership inside container
docker exec palmr ls -la /app/server/
```

### Verification Commands

Verify UID/GID settings are applied correctly:

```bash
# View startup logs for UID/GID configuration
docker-compose logs palmr | head -20

# Check file ownership in container
docker exec palmr ls -la /app/server/

# Verify process is running with correct UID/GID
docker exec palmr ps aux | grep node

# Check environment variables
docker exec palmr env | grep PALMR
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**NAS-specific debugging:**

```bash
# Synology - Check mount point ownership
ls -la /volume1/docker/palmr/

# QNAP - Check mount point ownership
ls -la /share/Container/palmr/

# Check NAS user configuration
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v nobody
```

**Docker bind mount issues:**

```bash
# Check if directories exist and are writable
test -w uploads && echo "uploads writable" || echo "uploads NOT writable"
test -w temp-uploads && echo "temp-uploads writable" || echo "temp-uploads NOT writable"

# Create directories with correct permissions
mkdir -p uploads temp-uploads
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) uploads temp-uploads
```

## When to Configure

UID/GID configuration is **required** when:

- ‚úÖ Using bind mounts (most common case)
- ‚úÖ Encountering "permission denied" errors
- ‚úÖ Deploying on NAS systems (Synology, QNAP, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Host system uses different default UID/GID values
- ‚úÖ Running multiple containers that need to share files

UID/GID configuration is **optional** when:

- ‚ùå Using Docker named volumes (Docker manages permissions)
- ‚ùå Not using bind mounts
- ‚ùå No permission errors occurring

---

## Migration Guide

### Existing Installations

To add UID/GID configuration to running installations:

1. **Stop the container**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Backup your data**

   ```bash
   cp -r ./data ./data-backup
   # or
   cp -r ./uploads ./uploads-backup
   cp -r ./temp-uploads ./temp-uploads-backup
   ```

3. **Check your UID/GID**

   ```bash
   id
   ```

4. **Update configuration**
   Add UID/GID variables to your `docker-compose.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     - PALMR_UID=1000
     - PALMR_GID=1000
   ```

5. **Restart with new configuration**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

## Implementation Details

The UID/GID configuration process:

1. **Detection** - Environment variables are read during container startup
2. **Ownership Update** - File permissions are adjusted to match target UID/GID
3. **Privilege Drop** - Application runs with specified user permissions via `su-exec`
4. **Logging** - Configuration changes are logged for verification

This approach provides automatic permission management without user creation or system modification.

---

## Build-Time Configuration

For custom base images with different default values:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg PALMR_UID=2000 \
  --build-arg PALMR_GID=2000 \
  -t palmr:custom .
```

Runtime environment variables override build-time defaults.

---

## Benefits

- **Zero Configuration** - Works automatically when environment variables are set
- **Universal Compatibility** - Supports any valid UID/GID combination
- **NAS Optimized** - Tested with major NAS platforms
- **Backward Compatible** - Existing deployments continue without modification
- **Performance Optimized** - Lightweight implementation using `su-exec`

## Summary

For most users experiencing permission issues with bind mounts:

1. **Find your UID/GID**: Run `id` command
2. **Add to docker-compose.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - PALMR_UID=1000
     - PALMR_GID=1000
   ```
3. **Restart**: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

This ensures compatibility between Palmr's UID/GID and your host system's file ownership.
