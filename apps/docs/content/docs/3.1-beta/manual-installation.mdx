Hey there! Looking to run **Palmr.** your way, with complete control over every piece of the stack? This manual installation guide is for you. No Docker, no pre-built containers just the raw source code to tweak, customize, and deploy as you see fit.

> **Prefer a quicker setup?** If this hands-on approach feels like overkill, check out our [**Quick Start (Docker)**](/docs/3.1-beta/quick-start) guide for a fast, containerized deployment. This manual path is tailored for developers who want to dive deep, modify the codebase, or integrate custom services.

Here's what you'll do at a glance:

1. **Clone** the repository to get the code.
2. **Configure** `.env` files for backend and frontend.
3. **Install** JavaScript dependencies using `pnpm`.
4. **Generate** the Prisma client and run database migrations.
5. **Seed** the database with initial Palmr. data.
6. **Build & start** the backend (Fastify API).
7. **Build & serve** the frontend (Next.js app).

We've broken down each step below feel free to jump to the section you're working on!

## Before you start

Let's make sure your environment is ready to roll. Check that you've got these tools installed and set up on your system:

- <span style={{ color: "#16a34a" }}>Node.js</span> *(Powers our JavaScript/TypeScript apps)*
- <span style={{ color: "#16a34a" }}>pnpm</span> *(Our go-to package manager)*
- <span style={{ color: "#16a34a" }}>Git</span> *(For cloning and managing the repo)*

⚠️ **Heads Up on Package Managers**: Palmr. was built and tested with `pnpm`. While you _could_ try `npm`, `yarn`, or `bun`, we strongly recommend sticking with `pnpm` to avoid compatibility headaches.

### System requirements

- **Operating System**: MacOS or Linux (recommended for best results)
  - Windows works but hasn't been thoroughly tested.
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM is suggested.
- **Storage**: Depends on how much file storage you'll need.
- **CPU**: 2+ cores for smooth performance.

## Let's Get Palmr. Running

### Step 1: Clone the repository

First things first, grab a local copy of the Palmr. codebase. Run this command to clone the official repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr.git
```

Once it's done, you'll have a new directory with the project structure. Inside, the `apps` folder holds the key pieces: `docs`, `server`, and `web`. For this guide, we're focusing on `server` (our Fastify backend) and `web` (our Next.js frontend).

---

### Step 2: Set up the backend

Let's get the backend up and running. Start by navigating to the server directory:

```bash
cd ./apps/server
```

#### Configure environment variables

Before anything else, we need to set up the environment variables Palmr. relies on. We've included a handy template file called `.env.example` to get you started. Create your own `.env` file with this command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This copies the template into a new `.env` file with all the necessary settings. Open it up if you need to tweak anything specific to your setup.

#### Install dependencies

Next, let's install the backend dependencies. With Node.js and `pnpm` ready, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This pulls in everything needed for the backend, including Prisma, our database ORM.

#### Generate Prisma client

Now, generate the Prisma client tailored for Palmr. with:

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma generate
```

This sets up the interface for smooth database interactions.

#### Deploy Prisma migrations

With the client ready, apply the database schema using:

```bash
pnpm dlx prisma migrate deploy
```

This ensures your database structure is set up with all the required migrations.

#### Seed the database

Let's populate the database with some initial data. Run the seeding script:

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

This adds the baseline data Palmr. needs to function properly.

#### Build and run the backend

Finally, build the backend app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Once the build is complete, start the service:

```bash
pnpm start
```

To confirm everything's working, check out the API documentation at:

```bash
http://localhost:3333/docs
```

This page lists all available API endpoints and how to use them.

### Step 3: Set up the frontend

With the backend humming, let's tackle the frontend setup.

#### Navigate to the Frontend Directory

If you're in the `server` folder, move to `web` with:

```bash
cd ../web
```

Or, from the repo root, use:

```bash
cd apps/web
```

#### Configure environment variables

Just like the backend, set up the frontend environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This creates a `.env` file with the necessary configurations for the frontend.

#### Install dependencies

Install all the frontend dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Build and run the frontend

Build the production version of the frontend:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Once that's done, serve it up:

```bash
pnpm serve
```

Now, open your browser and head to:

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see the full Palmr. application ready to go!

## Quick notes

This guide sets up Palmr. using the local file system for storage. Want to use an S3-compatible object storage instead? You can configure that in the `.env` file. Check the Palmr. documentation for details on setting up S3 storage just update the environment variables, then build and run as shown here.

## Command cheat sheet

Here's a quick reference for all the commands we've covered perfect for copy-pasting once you're familiar with the steps:

```bash
# --- Backend (Fastify API) ---
cd apps/server
pnpm install
pnpm dlx prisma generate
pnpm dlx prisma migrate deploy
pnpm db:seed
pnpm run build
pnpm start

# --- Frontend (Next.js) ---
cd apps/web
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm serve
```

> **Tip**: Keep this handy in your clipboard for your first setup run.

## What's next?

Palmr. is now up and running locally . Here are some suggested next steps:

- **Manage Users**: Dive into the [Users Management](/docs/3.1-beta/manage-users) guide.
- **Switch to Object Storage**: Update `.env` variables to use an S3-compatible bucket (see Quick Notes above).
- **Secure Your Instance**: Put Palmr. behind a reverse proxy like **Nginx** or **Caddy** and enable HTTPS.
- **Learn the Internals**: Explore how everything connects in the [Architecture](/docs/3.1-beta/architecture) overview.

Jump into whichever area fits your needs our docs are designed for exploration in any order.

## Wrapping up

Congrats! You've successfully set up a production-ready instance of Palmr. through this detailed manual process. From cloning the repo to deploying the app, you've tackled every step like a pro.
