## Setting up Kinde Auth Application

### Creating a Kinde application

To get started with Kinde Auth authentication, you'll need to create an application in your Kinde Dashboard.

1. **Navigate to Kinde Dashboard**: Go to [your-tenant.kinde.com/admin](https://your-tenant.kinde.com/admin)

<ZoomableImage src="/assets/v3/oidc/kinde/kinde-dashboard.png" alt="Kinde Dashboard" />

2. **Create new application**: Click **"Add application"** button in the center of the page.

3. **Select application type**: Choose **"Back-end web"** for web-based Palmr instances

4. **Enter application details**:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name like "Palmr File Sharing"

<ZoomableImage src="/assets/v3/oidc/kinde/application-type.png" alt="Kinde Application Type Selection" />

5. **Create application**: Click **"Save"** to generate your Kinde application

### Configuring application settings

After creating your application, you'll be redirected to the application page.

<ZoomableImage src="/assets/v3/oidc/kinde/application-page.png" alt="Kinde Application Page" />

Click on the **"Details"** tab on the sidebar to configure the application settings and get the OAuth credentials.

  alt="Kinde Application Details"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

### Getting OAuth credentials

Now you'll get the credentials that Palmr will use to authenticate with Kinde.

1. **Copy Domain**: Note your Kinde domain (e.g., `your-tenant.kinde.com`)

2. **Copy Client ID**: The Client ID is displayed in the **"Client ID"** field

3. **Copy Client Secret**: The Client Secret is displayed in the **"Client secret"** field

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/kinde/oauth-credentials.png"
  alt="Kinde OAuth Credentials"
  legend="The client ID and client secret shown in the image are examples only (fake credentials). You must use your own credentials from Kinde."
/>

4. **Save credentials**: Copy the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** for later use

> **Note:** For now you only need this configuration, you can come back here later to configure the application as you want.

###**Configure application URLs**:

You'll need to configure several URLs in your Kinde application settings. Here's what to add for each environment:

#### Allowed callback URLs

| Environment | URL                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/providers/kinde/callback`      |
| Development | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/providers/kinde/callback`       |
| Custom Port | `https://yourdomain.com:5487/api/auth/providers/kinde/callback` |

#### Application homepage URI

| Environment | URL                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://yourdomain.com`      |
| Development | `http://localhost:3000`       |
| Custom Port | `https://yourdomain.com:5487` |

#### Application login URI

| Environment | URL                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://yourdomain.com/login`      |
| Development | `http://localhost:3000/login`       |
| Custom Port | `https://yourdomain.com:5487/login` |

#### Allowed logout redirect URLs

| Environment | URL                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://yourdomain.com`      |
| Development | `http://localhost:3000`       |
| Custom Port | `https://yourdomain.com:5487` |

> **Note:** Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name in all production and custom port URLs.
> **Note:** You can add multiple redirect URIs for different environments (development, staging, production).

## Account linking

By default, if a user is already registered in Palmr with their Kinde Auth email, they will be automatically linked to their Palmr account.

> **Note:** You can't disable account linking. If you want to unlink a user from their Kinde Auth account, you need to delete the user from Palmr.

---

## Technical configuration

Kinde Auth's technical configuration is handled automatically, but understanding the setup can help with troubleshooting:

```yaml
Provider Type: OAuth 2.0 with OIDC Discovery
Issuer URL: https://your-tenant.kinde.com
Authorization Endpoint: /oauth2/auth
Token Endpoint: /oauth2/token
UserInfo Endpoint: /oauth2/user_profile
Scopes: openid profile email
```

### Field mappings

Palmr automatically maps Kinde Auth user information to local user accounts:

- **User ID**: Maps from Kinde's `id` field
- **Email**: Maps from Kinde's `preferred_email` field
- **Full Name**: Maps from Kinde's `first_name` and `last_name` fields
- **First Name**: Maps from Kinde's `first_name` field
- **Last Name**: Maps from Kinde's `last_name` field
- **Avatar**: Maps from Kinde's `picture` field
- **Username**: Maps from Kinde's `preferred_username` field

### Kinde Auth-specific features

- **Custom Claims**: Can include custom user metadata and app metadata
- **Social Logins**: Supports integration with various social providers
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Supports Kinde's MFA features
- **Modern APIs**: Clean REST APIs and comprehensive SDKs
- **Developer Tools**: Excellent documentation and developer experience

## Testing the configuration

### Verifying the setup

After configuring Kinde Auth authentication, test the integration to ensure everything works correctly.

1. **Check login page**: Navigate to your Palmr login page and verify the "Sign in with Kinde" button appears

2. **Test authentication flow**: Click the Kinde Auth sign-in button and complete the authentication process

3. **Verify user creation**: Confirm that a new user account is created (if auto-registration is enabled)

### Login flow verification

The complete authentication process should work as follows:

1. **User clicks "Sign in with Kinde"**: The browser redirects to Kinde's authorization page
2. **User authenticates**: User completes authentication through Kinde (login, MFA, etc.)
3. **Kinde redirects back to Palmr**: User returns to Palmr with authentication tokens
4. **Palmr creates or updates user**: User account is automatically managed with Kinde information
5. **User accesses Palmr**: User is logged in with their Kinde identity

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Redirect URI mismatch error

**Error message**: `invalid_redirect_uri`

**Cause**: The redirect URI in your request doesn't match what's configured in Kinde application.

**Solution**:

1. Check the exact URL in the error message
2. Add this exact URL to your Kinde application's redirect URIs
3. Ensure you include the correct protocol (http/https) and port
4. Remove any trailing slashes unless they're in the callback URL

### Access denied error

**Error message**: `access_denied`

**Cause**: User denied permissions or the application isn't properly configured.

**Solution**:

1. Verify that your Kinde application requests the correct scopes
2. Check that users are granting permissions during the authorization flow
3. Ensure your application is not restricted or disabled
4. Verify the application has proper permissions set up

### Invalid client error

**Error message**: `invalid_client`

**Cause**: Incorrect Client ID, Client Secret, or Domain.

**Solution**:

1. Double-check that you've copied the credentials correctly from Kinde
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the credentials
3. Verify you're using the correct domain format (e.g., `your-tenant.kinde.com`)
4. Generate a new Client Secret if necessary

### Domain configuration issues

**Error message**: Domain not found or invalid

**Cause**: Incorrect Kinde domain or tenant configuration.

**Solution**:

1. Verify your Kinde domain is correct (e.g., `your-tenant.kinde.com`)
2. Check that your Kinde tenant is active and not suspended
3. Ensure you're using the correct region for your tenant
4. Verify DNS resolution for your Kinde domain

### Custom claims not available

**Cause**: Custom claims not properly configured in Kinde.

**Solution**:

1. Check Kinde custom claims configuration
2. Verify that custom claims are included in the ID token
3. Ensure the claims are properly formatted and accessible
4. Test with a user that has the expected custom claims

## Security best practices

### Credential management

- **Never expose secrets**: Keep your Client Secret secure and never commit it to version control
- **Rotate credentials regularly**: Generate new Client Secrets periodically for enhanced security
- **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, not config files
- **Monitor access logs**: Regularly review authentication logs for suspicious activity

### Scope and permission management

- **Minimal scopes**: Only request `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes as required by Palmr
- **User consent**: Ensure users understand what permissions they're granting
- **Regular audits**: Review which users have connected their Kinde Auth accounts
- **Access reviews**: Periodically check user access and remove inactive accounts

### Production considerations

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Configure proper domains**: Use production domains in Kinde application settings
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify the complete authentication flow before going live
- **Plan for failures**: Have fallback authentication methods available

## Next steps

With Kinde Auth authentication configured, you might want to:

- **Configure additional providers**: Set up other OIDC providers for more authentication options
- **Customize user management**: Fine-tune auto-registration and admin assignment rules
- **Review security settings**: Ensure your authentication setup meets your security requirements
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of authentication patterns and user activity
