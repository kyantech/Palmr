### Redirect URIs

| Environment | URL                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/providers/zitadel/callback`      |
| Development | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/providers/zitadel/callback`       |
| Custom Port | `https://yourdomain.com:5487/api/auth/providers/zitadel/callback` |

### Post Logout Redirect URIs

| Environment | URL                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://yourdomain.com`      |
| Development | `http://localhost:3000`       |
| Custom Port | `https://yourdomain.com:5487` |

> **Note:** Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name in all production and custom port URLs.
> **Note:** If you using http:// (not https://) in your redirect URIs, you need to enable `Development mode` switch.
> **Note:** You can add multiple redirect URIs for different environments (development, staging, production).

  alt="Zitadel Application Summary"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

You can click on **"Create"** to create your application.

### Getting OAuth credentials

After creating your application, a modal will appear with the credentials that Palmr will use to authenticate with Zitadel.

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/zitadel/credentials-modal.png"
  alt="Zitadel OAuth Credentials"
  legend="The client ID and client secret shown in the image are examples only (fake credentials). You must use your own credentials from Zitadel."
/>

you can copy the credentials and save them in a safe place for later use.

### Final Zitadel configuration

**Confirm the Zitadel application configuration**:

After closing the modal, you'll be redirected to the Zitadel application page.

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/zitadel/application-page.png"
  alt="Zitadel Application Page"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

Confirm the application configuration fields:

- **Application Type**: The Application Type has been set to **"Web"**
- **Response Type**: The Response Type has been set to **"Code"**
- **Authentication Method**: The Authentication Method has been set to **"Basic"**
- **Grant Types**: The Grant Types has been set to **"Authorization Code"**
- **Refresh Token**: The Refresh Token has been set to **"Disabled"**

You can edit the application configuration if you want to change something and click on **"Save"** to save the application configuration.

> **Note:** If you edit your client ID, you need to update the credentials that you saved in the previous step.

Select the **"Token Settings"** section in the side menu, you can configure the token settings for your application.

The default Auth Token Type is **"Bearer"** and you can change it to **"JWT"** and click on **"Save"** to save the token settings.

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/zitadel/token-settings.png"
  alt="Zitadel Auth Token Settings"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

Click on **Redirect Settings** section in the side menu, you can configure the redirect settings for your application. Just confirm the previous URLs you have configured in the previous step. If you want to add more redirect URLs, you can add them by clicking on **"+"** button. If you need to edit the redirect URLs, you can edit them by clicking on the pen icon.

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/zitadel/redirect-settings-page.png"
  alt="Zitadel Redirect Settings"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

The last step in Zitadel is grab your instance URL. You can find it clicking on the **"URLs"** in the side menu.

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/zitadel/urls-page.png"
  alt="Zitadel Instance URL"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

You dont need copy the complete URL, just the domain name and protocol and port if you are using a custom port.
For example: `https://palmr-zaxijp.us1.zitadel.cloud` (image bellow case) or `https://zitadel.yourdomain.com` or `https://zitadel.yourdomain.com:5487` if you are using a custom port.

> **Note:** In Zitadel we finish the configuration. Let's go to Palmr to configure the provider. Remember you need `Client ID`, `Client Secret` and `Instance URL` to configure the provider in Palmr.

## Account linking

By default, if a user is already registered in Palmr with their Zitadel email, they will be automatically linked to their Palmr account.

> **Note:** You can't disable account linking. If you want to unlink a user from their Zitadel account, you need to delete the user from Palmr.

---

## Technical configuration

Zitadel's technical configuration is handled automatically, but understanding the setup can help with troubleshooting:

```yaml
Provider Type: OAuth 2.0 with OIDC Discovery
Issuer URL: https://your-instance.zitadel.cloud
Authorization Endpoint: /oauth/v2/authorize
Token Endpoint: /oauth/v2/token
UserInfo Endpoint: /oidc/v1/userinfo
Scopes: openid profile email
```

### Field mappings

Palmr automatically maps Zitadel user information to local user accounts:

- **User ID**: Maps from Zitadel's `sub` field
- **Email**: Maps from Zitadel's `email` field
- **Full Name**: Maps from Zitadel's `name` field
- **First Name**: Maps from Zitadel's `given_name` field
- **Last Name**: Maps from Zitadel's `family_name` field
- **Avatar**: Maps from Zitadel's `picture` field
- **Username**: Maps from Zitadel's `preferred_username` field

## Testing the configuration

### Verifying the setup

After configuring Zitadel authentication, test the integration to ensure everything works correctly.

1. **Check login page**: Navigate to your Palmr login page and verify the "Sign in with Zitadel" button appears

2. **Test authentication flow**: Click the Zitadel sign-in button and complete the authentication process

3. **Verify user creation**: Confirm that a new user account is created (if auto-registration is enabled)

### Login flow verification

The complete authentication process should work as follows:

1. **User clicks "Sign in with Zitadel"**: The browser redirects to Zitadel's authorization page
2. **User authenticates**: User completes authentication through Zitadel (login, MFA, etc.)
3. **Zitadel redirects back to Palmr**: User returns to Palmr with authentication tokens
4. **Palmr creates or updates user**: User account is automatically managed with Zitadel information
5. **User accesses Palmr**: User is logged in with their Zitadel identity

**Cause**: The redirect URI in your request doesn't match what's configured in Zitadel application.

**Solution**:

1. Check the exact URL in the error message
2. Add this exact URL to your Zitadel application's redirect URIs
3. Ensure you include the correct protocol (http/https) and port
4. Remove any trailing slashes unless they're in the callback URL

### Access denied error

**Error message**: `access_denied`

**Cause**: User denied permissions or the application isn't properly configured.

**Solution**:

1. Verify that your Zitadel application requests the correct scopes
2. Check that users are granting permissions during the authorization flow
3. Ensure your application is not restricted or disabled
4. Verify the application has proper permissions set up

### Invalid client error

**Error message**: `invalid_client`

**Cause**: Incorrect Client ID, Client Secret, or Instance URL.

**Solution**:

1. Double-check that you've copied the credentials correctly from Zitadel
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the credentials
3. Verify you're using the correct instance URL format
4. Generate a new Client Secret if necessary

### Instance URL configuration issues

**Error message**: Instance not found or invalid

**Cause**: Incorrect Zitadel instance URL or instance configuration.

## Security best practices

### Credential management

- **Never expose secrets**: Keep your Client Secret secure and never commit it to version control
- **Rotate credentials regularly**: Generate new Client Secrets periodically for enhanced security
- **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, not config files
- **Monitor access logs**: Regularly review authentication logs for suspicious activity

### Scope and permission management

- **Minimal scopes**: Only request `openid`, `profile`, and `email` scopes as required by Palmr
- **User consent**: Ensure users understand what permissions they're granting
- **Regular audits**: Review which users have connected their Zitadel accounts
- **Access reviews**: Periodically check user access and remove inactive accounts

### Production considerations

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Configure proper domains**: Use production domains in Zitadel application settings
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify the complete authentication flow before going live
- **Plan for failures**: Have fallback authentication methods available

---

## Next steps

With Zitadel authentication configured, you might want to:

- **Configure additional providers**: Set up other OIDC providers for more authentication options
- **Customize user management**: Fine-tune auto-registration and admin assignment rules
- **Review security settings**: Ensure your authentication setup meets your security requirements
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of authentication patterns and user activity
