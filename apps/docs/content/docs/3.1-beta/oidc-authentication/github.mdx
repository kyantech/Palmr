## Why use GitHub authentication?

GitHub authentication provides several advantages for developer-focused organizations and teams:

- **Developer-friendly** - Perfect for teams already using GitHub for development
- **Open-source integration** - Ideal for open-source projects and communities
- **Rich developer profiles** - Access to GitHub usernames, avatars, and organization memberships
- **Repository access** - Can leverage GitHub's permission system for additional features
- **No additional accounts** - Developers can access Palmr with their existing GitHub credentials

---

## Prerequisites

Before configuring GitHub authentication, ensure you have:

- **GitHub account** - Ability to create OAuth Apps on GitHub
- **Admin privileges in Palmr** - Required to configure OIDC settings

> **Note:** GitHub is pre-configured as an official provider in Palmr, which means the technical configuration is handled automatically. You only need to provide your OAuth credentials.

## Setting up GitHub OAuth App

### Creating a GitHub OAuth App

To get started with GitHub authentication, you'll need to create an OAuth App in your GitHub Developer Settings.

1. **Navigate to GitHub Developer Settings**: Go to [github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)

2. **Create new OAuth App**: Click **"New OAuth App"** button

<ZoomableImage src="/assets/v3/oidc/github/developer-settings.png" alt="GitHub Developer Settings" />

3. **Enter application details**:
   - **Application name**: Enter a descriptive name like "Palmr File Sharing"
   - **Homepage URL**: Enter your Palmr instance URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
   - **Application description**: Add a clear description of your Palmr instance
   - **Authorization callback URL**: Enter your callback URL (see below)

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/github/oauth-app-details.png"
  alt="GitHub OAuth App Details"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

**Set up callback URLs**: In the **"Authorization callback URL"** field, add your Palmr callback URL:

You'll need to configure several URLs in your GitHub OAuth App settings. Here's what to add for each environment:

### Authorization Callback URLs

| Environment | URL                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Production  | `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/providers/github/callback`      |
| Development | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/providers/github/callback`       |
| Custom Port | `https://yourdomain.com:5487/api/auth/providers/github/callback` |

> **Note:** Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name in all production and custom port URLs.
> **Note:** You can add multiple callback URLs for different environments (development, staging, production).

4. **Create application**: Click **"Register application"** to generate your OAuth App

### Getting OAuth credentials

Now you'll get the credentials that Palmr will use to authenticate with GitHub.

1. **Copy Client ID**: The Client ID is displayed on your OAuth App page

2. **Generate Client Secret**: Click **"Generate a new client secret"** to create a new secret

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/github/oauth-credentials.png"
  alt="GitHub OAuth Credentials"
  legend="The client ID and client secret shown in the image are examples only (fake credentials). You must use your own credentials from GitHub."
/>

3. **Save credentials**: Copy both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for later use

> **Important:** Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain. You can add multiple callback URLs for different environments (development, staging, production) by creating separate OAuth Apps.

## Configuring Palmr

### Accessing OIDC settings

To configure GitHub authentication in Palmr, you need administrator access to the settings panel.

1. **Login as administrator**: Sign in to Palmr with an admin account

2. **Access settings**: Click your profile picture in the header and select **Settings**

3. **Navigate to authentication**: Find and click on the **Authentication Providers** configuration section

<ZoomableImage src="/assets/v3/oidc/auth-providers.png" alt="Palmr Authentication Providers" />

### Enabling GitHub provider

GitHub comes pre-configured as an official provider, so the setup process is streamlined.

1. **Locate GitHub provider**: Find GitHub in the list of available providers

2. **Enable the provider**: Toggle the status to **Enabled**

<ZoomableImage src="/assets/v3/oidc/github/enabled-github.png" alt="Palmr GitHub Provider Enabled" />

After enabling the provider, click on the pen icon to configure the provider.

3. **Configure credentials**:
   - **Client ID**: Paste the Client ID from GitHub OAuth App
   - **Client Secret**: Paste the Client Secret from GitHub OAuth App
   - **Scopes**: Add the scopes you want to use. The default scopes are `user:email`.

<ZoomableImage
  src="/assets/v3/oidc/github/edit-github.png"
  alt="Edit GitHub Provider"
  legend="This is a fake application, you have to use your own."
/>

### Advanced configuration options

Configure additional settings to customize the authentication behavior:

**Auto Registration**: Enable this to automatically create user accounts when someone authenticates for the first time.

**Admin Email Domains**: Specify domains that should automatically receive admin privileges. For example, entering `yourcompany.com` will grant admin access to anyone with an email from that domain.

**Sort Order**: Control where the GitHub login button appears relative to other authentication providers.

**Icon**: you can choose the icon you want to use for the GitHub login button (default is `SiGithub`).

## Account linking

By default, if a user is already registered in Palmr with their GitHub email, they will be automatically linked to their Palmr account.

> **Note:** You can't disable account linking. If you want to unlink a user from their GitHub account, you need to delete the user from Palmr.

---

## Technical configuration

GitHub's technical configuration is handled automatically, but understanding the setup can help with troubleshooting:

```yaml
Provider Type: OAuth 2.0 with OIDC Discovery
Issuer URL: https://github.com
Authorization Endpoint: /login/oauth/authorize
Token Endpoint: /login/oauth/access_token
UserInfo Endpoint: https://api.github.com/user
Scopes: user:email
```

### Field mappings

Palmr automatically maps GitHub user information to local user accounts:

- **User ID**: Maps from GitHub's `id` field
- **Email**: Maps from GitHub's `email` field (from user:email scope)
- **Full Name**: Maps from GitHub's `name` field
- **Username**: Maps from GitHub's `login` field
- **Avatar**: Maps from GitHub's `avatar_url` field

---

## Testing the configuration

### Verifying the setup

After configuring GitHub authentication, test the integration to ensure everything works correctly.

1. **Check login page**: Navigate to your Palmr login page and verify the "Sign in with GitHub" button appears

2. **Test authentication flow**: Click the GitHub sign-in button and complete the authentication process

3. **Verify user creation**: Confirm that a new user account is created (if auto-registration is enabled)

### Login flow verification

The complete authentication process should work as follows:

1. **User clicks "Sign in with GitHub"**: The browser redirects to GitHub's authorization page
2. **User authorizes application**: User grants permissions for the requested scopes
3. **GitHub redirects back to Palmr**: User returns to Palmr with authentication tokens
4. **Palmr creates or updates user**: User account is automatically managed with GitHub information
5. **User accesses Palmr**: User is logged in with their GitHub identity

---

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Redirect URI mismatch error

**Error message**: `The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback URL for this application`

**Cause**: The redirect URI in your request doesn't match what's configured in GitHub OAuth App.

**Solution**:

1. Check the exact URL in the error message
2. Add this exact URL to your GitHub OAuth App's callback URL
3. Ensure you include the correct protocol (http/https) and port
4. Remove any trailing slashes unless they're in the callback URL

### Access denied error

**Error message**: `access_denied`

**Cause**: User denied permissions or the OAuth App isn't properly configured.

**Solution**:

1. Verify that your GitHub OAuth App requests the correct scopes
2. Check that users are granting permissions during the authorization flow
3. Ensure your OAuth App is not restricted or disabled
4. Verify the application has proper permissions set up

### Invalid client error

**Error message**: `invalid_client`

**Cause**: Incorrect Client ID or Client Secret.

**Solution**:

1. Double-check that you've copied the credentials correctly from GitHub
2. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the credentials
3. Generate a new Client Secret if necessary
4. Verify you're using the correct OAuth App in GitHub

### Email not available error

**Error message**: Email not provided or scope missing

**Cause**: GitHub OAuth App not configured with `user:email` scope or user's email is private.

**Solution**:

1. Verify that your GitHub OAuth App requests the `user:email` scope
2. Check that users have public email addresses or have granted email access
3. Ensure the scope configuration matches what Palmr expects
4. Test with a GitHub account that has a public email address

## Security best practices

### Credential management

- **Never expose secrets**: Keep your Client Secret secure and never commit it to version control
- **Rotate credentials regularly**: Generate new Client Secrets periodically for enhanced security
- **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, not config files
- **Monitor access logs**: Regularly review authentication logs for suspicious activity

### Scope and permission management

- **Minimal scopes**: Only request `user:email` scopes as required by Palmr
- **User consent**: Ensure users understand what permissions they're granting
- **Regular audits**: Review which users have connected their GitHub accounts
- **Access reviews**: Periodically check user access and remove inactive accounts

### Production considerations

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Configure proper domains**: Use production domains in GitHub OAuth App
- **Test thoroughly**: Verify the complete authentication flow before going live
- **Plan for failures**: Have fallback authentication methods available

---

## Next steps

With GitHub authentication configured, you might want to:

- **Configure additional providers**: Set up other OIDC providers for more authentication options
- **Customize user management**: Fine-tune auto-registration and admin assignment rules
- **Review security settings**: Ensure your authentication setup meets your security requirements
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of authentication patterns and user activity
