When deploying **Palmr.** behind a reverse proxy (like Traefik, Nginx, or Cloudflare), you need to configure secure cookie settings to ensure proper authentication. This guide covers the `SECURE_SITE` environment variable and related proxy configurations.

## Overview

Reverse proxies terminate SSL/TLS connections and forward requests to Palmr., which can cause authentication issues if cookies aren't configured properly for HTTPS environments. The `SECURE_SITE` environment variable controls cookie security settings to handle these scenarios.

## The SECURE_SITE Environment Variable

The `SECURE_SITE` variable configures how Palmr. handles authentication cookies based on your deployment environment:

### Configuration Options

| Value   | Cookie Settings                       | Use Case                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `true`  | `secure: true`, `sameSite: "lax"`     | HTTPS/Production with reverse proxy |
| `false` | `secure: false`, `sameSite: "strict"` | HTTP/Development (default)          |

### When to Use SECURE_SITE=true

Set `SECURE_SITE=true` in the following scenarios:

- ✅ **Reverse Proxy with HTTPS**: Traefik, Nginx, HAProxy with SSL termination
- ✅ **Cloud Providers**: Cloudflare, AWS ALB, Azure Application Gateway
- ✅ **CDN with HTTPS**: Any CDN that terminates SSL
- ✅ **Production Deployments**: When users access via HTTPS

### When to Use SECURE_SITE=false

Keep `SECURE_SITE=false` (default) for:

- ✅ **Local Development**: Running on `http://localhost`
- ✅ **Direct HTTP Access**: No reverse proxy involved
- ✅ **Testing Environments**: When using HTTP
- ✅ **HTTP Reverse Proxy**: Nginx, Apache, etc. without SSL termination

---

## HTTP Reverse Proxy Setup

**Docker Compose for HTTP Nginx:**

```yaml
environment:
  - SECURE_SITE=false # HTTP = false
```

> **⚠️ HTTP Security**: Remember that HTTP transmits data in plain text. Consider using HTTPS in production environments.

## Troubleshooting Authentication Issues

### Common Symptoms

If you experience authentication issues behind a reverse proxy:

- ❌ Login appears successful but redirects to login page
- ❌ "No Authorization was found in request.cookies" errors
- ❌ API requests return 401 Unauthorized
- ❌ User registration fails silently

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check Browser Developer Tools**:
   - Look for cookies in Application/Storage tab
   - Verify cookie has `Secure` flag when using HTTPS
   - Check if `SameSite` attribute is appropriate

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it palmr env | grep SECURE_SITE
   ```

3. **Test Cookie Settings**:
   - With `SECURE_SITE=false`: Should work on HTTP
   - With `SECURE_SITE=true`: Should work on HTTPS

### Common Fixes

**Problem**: Authentication fails with reverse proxy

**Solution**: Set `SECURE_SITE=true` and ensure proper headers:

```yaml
environment:
  - SECURE_SITE=true
```

**Problem**: Mixed content errors

**Solution**: Ensure proxy passes correct headers:

```yaml
# Traefik
- "traefik.http.middlewares.palmr-headers.headers.customrequestheaders.X-Forwarded-Proto=https"

# Nginx
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

**Problem**: Authentication fails with HTTP reverse proxy

**Solution**: Use `SECURE_SITE=false` and ensure proper cookie headers:

```yaml
environment:
  - SECURE_SITE=false # For HTTP proxy
```

```nginx
# Nginx - Add these headers for cookie handling
proxy_set_header Cookie $http_cookie;
proxy_pass_header Set-Cookie;
```

**Problem**: SQLite "readonly database" error with bind mounts

**Solution**: Configure proper UID/GID permissions:

```yaml
environment:
  - PALMR_UID=1000 # Your host UID (check with: id)
  - PALMR_GID=1000 # Your host GID
  - ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-key-here
```

> **💡 Note**: Check your host UID/GID with `id` command and use those values. See [UID/GID Configuration](/docs/3.1-beta/uid-gid-configuration) for detailed setup.

## Security Considerations

> **⚠️ Important**: Always use HTTPS in production environments. The `SECURE_SITE=true` setting ensures cookies are only sent over encrypted connections.

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Domains

If serving Palmr. on multiple domains, ensure consistent cookie settings:

```yaml
environment:
  - SECURE_SITE=true # Use for all HTTPS domains
```

### Development vs Production

Use environment-specific configurations:

**Development (HTTP):**

```yaml
environment:
  - SECURE_SITE=false
```

**Production (HTTPS):**

```yaml
environment:
  - SECURE_SITE=true
```

### Health Checks

Add health checks to ensure proper proxy configuration:

```yaml
services:
  palmr:
    # ... other config
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:5487/api/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

## Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues after following this guide:

1. **Check the Logs**: `docker logs palmr`
2. **Verify Headers**: Use browser dev tools or `curl -I`
3. **Test Direct Access**: Try accessing Palmr. directly (bypassing proxy)
4. **Open an Issue**: [Report bugs on GitHub](https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr/issues)

> **💡 Pro Tip**: When reporting issues, include your reverse proxy configuration and any relevant error messages from both Palmr. and your proxy logs.
