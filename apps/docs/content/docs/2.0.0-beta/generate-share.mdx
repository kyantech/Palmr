## 📤 Creating a share

Creating a share in Palmr is designed to be a straightforward and user-friendly experience that anyone can master quickly. While the platform offers several methods for share creation, we recommend beginning with the most accessible approach: utilizing the **Home Page**, particularly through the well-organized **Recent Shares** section.

### Home Page

When you visit the home page, you'll immediately notice the **"Recent Shares"** section, which serves as your central hub for file sharing. For new users who haven't created any shares yet, this section presents a clean, welcoming interface as follows:

For first-time users, the interface features a prominently positioned **"Create Share"** button that stands out against the clean background, making it impossible to miss.

> Note: One of Palmr's unique features is its flexibility - you don't need to upload files to create a share! This might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's a deliberately designed feature that many users find invaluable for their specific workflows and use cases. This approach allows you to set up the sharing framework first and add content later.

This design philosophy reflects Palmr's user-centric approach: you can establish your share's parameters and settings first, then populate it with files at your convenience. Furthermore, all aspects of your share remain fully editable at any time, providing maximum flexibility.

To initiate the share creation process, locate and click the **"Create Share"** button positioned centrally within the **Recent Shares** section. This action will trigger the appearance of a comprehensive **Create Share** modal window:

Within the modal, you'll find various fields to customize your share. While some fields are optional, they each serve important functions in controlling how your share behaves. Pay particular attention to these three powerful security options - **Expiration Date**, **Max Views**, and **Password** - as they significantly enhance your control over how recipients interact with your shared content:

- **Password:** Adding this extra layer of security ensures that only recipients with the correct password can gain access to your shared content, providing an additional verification step.
- **Max Views:** This feature allows you to set a specific limit on the number of times your share can be accessed. Once this threshold is reached, the share becomes inaccessible unless you, as the creator, choose to adjust or remove the viewing limit.
- **Expiration Date:** By setting this parameter, you can determine precisely how long your share remains accessible. After the specified date passes, the share automatically deactivates, though you retain the ability to extend this deadline if needed.

While the **name** field isn't mandatory, we strongly encourage users to assign meaningful names to their shares for easier management and organization of multiple shares over time.

After successfully creating a share, the **Recent Shares** section transforms into an informative table display, presenting comprehensive details through the following columns:

- **Name**
- **Created At**
- **Expires At**
- **Status**
- **Security**
- **Files**
- **Recipients**
- **Actions**

For your convenience, once you've created your first share, a **"New Share"** button appears in the upper right corner of the **Recent Shares** section, making it easy to create additional shares.

This conveniently positioned button provides quick access to the **Create Share** modal whenever you need to create another share.

To maintain a clean and manageable interface, the **Recent Shares** section displays your **last 5 shares** by default. When you need to access your complete sharing history, simply click the **"View All"** button to see your entire collection of shares.

Upon clicking this button, you'll be seamlessly redirected to the comprehensive **Shares Management** page.

For quick access to your complete share collection, you can also reach the **Shares Management** page by clicking the conveniently placed **"My Shares"** card on the home page.

### 📊 Shares Management Page

The **Shares Management** page functions similarly to the **Uploads Management** page but offers expanded capabilities. Here, you'll find a complete overview where you can **add, remove, edit, and view all created shares** without being restricted to the five-share limit of the Recent Shares section.

Each share has an **Actions** column with the following options:

## 🔗 Generate Share Link

The **Generate Link** feature allows you to create a customizable sharing link for easy distribution of your content.

After generation, the system presents you with the link for immediate viewing and copying.

A convenient dropdown menu provides options to either edit the generated link's settings or copy it to your clipboard.

When recipients access your generated link, they'll be able to both **view and download** the shared files according to the permissions you've set.
