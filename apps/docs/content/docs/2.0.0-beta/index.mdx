**Palmr.** is a powerful and **flexible open-source alternative** to popular file transfer services like **WeTransfer**, **SendGB**, **Send Anywhere** and **Files.fm**. The key advantage of Palmr. is that you can **host it on your own infrastructure**, such as a **dedicated server** or **VPS**, giving you full control over your files and data security without relying on third-party services or worrying about artificial limits or high fees.

## **Why Choose Palmr.?**

### ðŸš« **No Artificial Limits**

Unlike traditional file transfer services that impose arbitrary restrictions, Palmr. takes a fundamentally different approach by removing all artificial constraints on file sizes and quantities. The only practical limitation you'll encounter is the **available storage** space on your server or VPS infrastructure. This means that as long as you have adequate storage capacity in your hosting environment, you have complete freedom to transfer files of any size and in any quantity. There are no premium tiers to unlock additional features, no intrusive advertisements to navigate around, and absolutely no hidden charges or unexpected fees that might surprise you later. This unrestricted approach ensures that your file transfer capabilities are determined solely by your infrastructure choices rather than arbitrary service limitations.

### ðŸŒŸ **Open Source and Free**

Palmr. is completely **open source** and free to use, which means there are no licensing fees, subscription costs, or hidden charges associated with implementing and maintaining the software. This commitment to open source principles ensures complete transparency and freedom in how you utilize the platform. You can:

- Deploy it on any infrastructure of your choice (VPS, dedicated server, Docker, cloud platforms, or other hosting environments), giving you complete flexibility in your hosting decisions.
- Review and audit the entire codebase to ensure security and integrity, allowing you to verify that the software meets your organization's security standards and compliance requirements.
- Contribute improvements or custom features to enhance the platform's functionality, participating in the collaborative development process that makes open source software so powerful.
- Adapt it for different use cases as needed, whether you're using it for personal file sharing, business operations, or specialized applications that require custom modifications.

### ðŸ”’ **Security and Privacy Under Your Control**

When you host Palmr. on your infrastructure, you maintain **full control over your data** through end-to-end management of the storage and transfer process. By keeping files within your own hosting environment, you eliminate security vulnerabilities that could arise from third-party handling. Your files never get stored or processed by external services, ensuring complete **privacy** and **confidentiality** of transferred information. This allows you to implement security protocols and compliance measures that match your specific requirements.

By eliminating third-party involvement, you gain peace of mind knowing that the files are never handled by external providers. This guarantees that you retain full control over data handling and processing, reinforcing the confidentiality of sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

With Palmr., your security and privacy are entirely in your hands, making it a powerful and reliable solution for organizations that require full control over their data, whether for internal use or for compliance with regulations.
