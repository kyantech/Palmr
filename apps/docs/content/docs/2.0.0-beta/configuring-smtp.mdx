title: ‚úâÔ∏è Configuring SMTP
---

For Palmr to function with all its best features, we need to configure our email server. To make this easier, there is a built-in configuration panel inside **Settings** in Palmr. However, only users with an **ADMIN** profile can access and configure these settings.

## ‚ùì Why Configure SMTP?

The main functionalities that depend on SMTP configuration are:

- üîë **Password Reset** ‚Äì Users who forget their password and cannot access the **Settings** panel need this feature.
- üìß **Email Notifications** ‚Äì Recipients will receive emails when new shares are sent to them.

Now, let's go through the step-by-step process to configure the **SMTP Server**.

### üîß Accessing SMTP Settings

To access **Settings**, an **ADMIN** user must click on the profile picture in the **header** and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring SMTP Server

The first step is to **enable SMTP** by selecting "Yes" in the **SMTP Enabled** field.

Once SMTP is enabled, you can configure the other necessary fields:

- **Sender Name** ‚Äì This will appear as the sender‚Äôs name in emails. (Example: "Palmr")
- **Sender Email** ‚Äì The email address from which notifications will be sent. (Example: "noreply@palmr.app")
- **SMTP Server** ‚Äì The SMTP server address. You can use any email service provider. For Gmail, use `smtp.gmail.com` (this is the recommended option and set as default).
- **SMTP Port** ‚Äì The server port. For Gmail, the standard port is **587**.
- **SMTP Username** ‚Äì The username for the SMTP server. For Gmail, enter your email address.
- **SMTP Password** ‚Äì The SMTP password. (Generate an App Password for Gmail)

> **Important:** If using **Gmail**, you need to generate an **App Password** instead of using your standard email password.
> For other email services, consult the official documentation of the service provider you are using. We recommend using Gmail for simplicity and limits the number of emails sent.
