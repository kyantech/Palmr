The project leverages next-intl, a powerful and flexible internationalization (i18n) library, to provide comprehensive language support across the entire application. This robust solution enables seamless translation management, date/time formatting, number formatting, and pluralization rules across different locales. The integration of next-intl ensures consistent internationalization throughout the application's components, pages, and features, while maintaining optimal performance through efficient bundle splitting and lazy loading of language resources. With its TypeScript support and React Server Components compatibility, next-intl serves as the foundation for delivering a truly global and accessible user experience.

### 🔄 Language Selection

The application provides two convenient methods for language selection, ensuring a seamless user experience:

### 🤖 1. Automatic Detection

- The application features sophisticated automatic detection of the user's preferred browser language settings
- Intelligently utilizes the browser's preconfigured language preferences to set the initial application language

### 👆 2. Manual Selection

![](/assets/v1/main/language/language-selector.png)

- Users have complete control to manually select their preferred language through an intuitive language selector interface in the UI
- Selected language preferences are persistently stored in the browser's localStorage for a consistent experience across sessions

### ⭐ Default Language

English (en-US) serves as the system's fallback language, ensuring consistent functionality even when language detection or selection encounters issues. This means that if a user's preferred language is not available or if there are any problems with language selection, the application will automatically default to English. This fallback mechanism is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience and preventing any potential language-related disruptions. Additionally, all new features and updates are first implemented in English before being translated into other supported languages, ensuring that the English version always remains the most up-to-date and comprehensive.

### 🔍 Language Detection

The application employs advanced detection mechanisms to automatically identify and apply the user's browser language settings as the initial language configuration. For maximum flexibility, users can easily override this selection at any time using the convenient language switcher, accessible via the globe icon prominently displayed in the navigation bar.

### ↔️ RTL Support

The application incorporates comprehensive right-to-left (RTL) text handling capabilities, with particular attention paid to Arabic (ar-SA) language requirements, ensuring proper text alignment, layout direction, and user interface elements.
