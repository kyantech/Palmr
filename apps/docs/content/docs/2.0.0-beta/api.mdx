## ðŸ“š Accessing the API Documentation

Palmr. provides a **comprehensive, well-documented, and fully typed API** that has been carefully designed to ensure maximum developer productivity and ease of integration.

### ðŸŽ¯ Scalar-Based Documentation

This API can be accessed through dedicated documentation endpoints at:

- **In a production environment:** `{your_server_domain}/docs` or `{your_server_ip}/docs`
- **In a local environment:** http://localhost:3333/docs

The API documentation is powered by **[Scalar](https://scalar.com/)**, which provides developers with a sophisticated and fully interactive interface for exploring, testing, and validating all available requests within the Palmr. ecosystem. This modern documentation platform enables real-time testing and visualization of API responses. Below is an example screenshot of the API documentation interface:

We have made a deliberate decision to **not provide an online version** of the API documentation, as the endpoints and functionality may vary significantly depending on the specific version of Palmr. you have deployed in your environment. To ensure you're always working with accurate and version-specific documentation, we strongly recommend accessing the documentation only after initializing your API service. It's important to note that the API service is specifically designated as the **server** component within the official Palmr. GitHub repository.

We strongly recommend utilizing **Scalar** as your primary tool for querying and testing the API, as the entire documentation system has been carefully optimized and designed with Scalar integration in mind. Scalar provides developers with an exceptionally intuitive and feature-rich interactive environment that streamlines the process of exploring endpoints, constructing and sending requests, and analyzing responses directly within its sophisticated interface.

### ðŸ”„ Swagger-Based Documentation

Understanding that developers may have different preferences or requirements, we also maintain a **Swagger-based version** of the documentation for those who prefer this widely-adopted documentation standard or require compatibility with existing tools and workflows.

This alternative documentation format can be accessed at the following endpoints:

- **In a production environment:** `{your_server_domain}/swagger` or `{your_server_ip}/swagger`
- **In a local environment:** http://localhost:3333/swagger

Rest assured that both the Scalar and Swagger documentation versions maintain complete parity in terms of endpoint coverage and provide equally comprehensive documentation levels, ensuring successful testing and system integration regardless of your chosen documentation platform.

These carefully curated documentation options have been implemented to ensure that developers have access to all the necessary resources, detailed information, and interactive tools required for seamless integration between Palmr. and both internal systems and third-party services.
