title: üì§ Uploading Files
---

To upload a file in Palmr, the process has been designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. The platform offers two convenient locations where users can upload their files, ensuring flexibility and ease of access. Each location has been optimized to provide a seamless upload experience.

Before we delve into the specifics of file uploading, it's essential to understand that file sharing stands at the heart of Palmr's functionality. This core feature enables users to collaborate and distribute content efficiently. To initiate this collaborative process, you'll need to first upload one or more files to your account. Once your files are uploaded, you can proceed to create a sharing session, which serves as a container that can encompass either a single file or multiple files, depending on your specific needs.

Now let's explore the file upload process in detail. As previously mentioned, the procedure has been streamlined for maximum efficiency, and you can initiate file uploads from two distinct locations: **the Home Page** or **the My Files Page**. We will thoroughly examine both options in the following sections, though it's worth noting that the underlying upload mechanism remains consistent regardless of which location you choose.

## üè† Home Page

On the home page, you'll find a dedicated "Recent Uploads" section. When you're using Palmr for the first time and haven't uploaded any files yet, this section will appear in its initial state:

To begin the upload process, locate and click the "Upload File" button. This action will trigger a modal window where you can browse and select the desired file from your device. For enhanced user experience, certain file formats including images, audio files, and video content will automatically generate a preview within the modal.

Upon selecting your file, you'll be presented with two options: confirm the upload by clicking the "Upload" button, or if you need to make changes, you can abort the process by selecting the "Cancel" button.

After successfully uploading one or more files, the "Recent Uploads" section will automatically refresh to display your newly added content:

Should you wish to upload additional files from this view, simply click the "Upload File" button positioned in the upper right corner of the section, then follow the same straightforward procedure outlined above.

It's important to note that the home page list displays only your last 5 uploads for quick access. For a comprehensive view of your uploaded files or to upload additional content, you'll need to navigate to the "My Files" page. This can be accomplished in two ways: either click the "View All" button located in the upper right corner of the section, or select the "My Files" card directly from the home page.

Or:

## üìÇ My Files Page

Upon accessing the **"My Files"** page, you'll be presented with this comprehensive layout:

This interface provides enhanced functionality, allowing you to **filter** through your uploaded files for better organization. You can also continue uploading new files by clicking the **"Upload File"** button and following the previously described upload procedure.

For clarity, it's worth mentioning that the tables found in both the **"Recent Files"** section and the **"My Files"** page share the same structure and organization ‚Äî the primary distinction lies in the quantity of files displayed. While the **"Recent Files"** section provides quick access to your five most recent uploads, the **"My Files"** table presents a comprehensive view of your entire upload history.

The table provides detailed information through the following fields:

- **Name**
- **Description**
- **Size**
- **Created At**
- **Updated At**
- **Actions**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Actions Column

Within the **"Actions"** column, you'll discover an interactive icon that reveals the following dropdown menu:

While most options are self-explanatory, let's examine the Edit functionality in detail:

- Edit ‚Äì Opens a modal where you can modify various file attributes including the file name, description, and other relevant details.

  ![Edit Modal](/assets/v1/main/files/edit-modal.png)

- The platform also provides the ability to **delete** files directly through the dropdown menu by selecting the **Delete** option.

For enhanced user experience, the preview functionality is available for common media formats including images, audio files, PDFs, and videos. For all other file types, you can easily access the content through the **Download** option in the dropdown menu.
