### üîë GitHub Login

Before you can contribute, you need to be logged into your GitHub account. If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up for free at **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**. Having a GitHub account is essential as it allows you to fork repositories, submit pull requests, and interact with other contributors. Make sure to use a professional email address when creating your account, and consider enabling two-factor authentication for enhanced security. Once your account is set up, you can customize your profile and start exploring the vast open-source community on GitHub.

### üîç Access the Repository

Once you're logged in, go to the Palmr repository by clicking on this link: **[https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr](https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr)**. The repository contains all the source code, documentation, and resources for the Palmr project. Take a moment to explore the repository structure, including the README file, which provides an overview of the project.

Alternatively, you can search for "Palmr" in the GitHub search bar and click on the repository owned by **kyantech**. When searching, make sure you're looking at the official repository by checking the owner and repository name. The repository should have a description that matches the Palmr project and show recent activity from the maintainers. You can also check the number of stars, forks, and watchers to verify you're accessing the correct repository.

---

### üç¥ Fork the Repository

To contribute to the project, you'll need to create your own copy of the repository. This is called a **fork**. Here's how to do it:

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page.
2. Select where you want to fork the repository (your personal account or an organization).
3. Wait a few moments while GitHub creates your fork.
4. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
5. You'll be automatically redirected to your forked repository once it's ready.

The fork will maintain a connection to the original repository, allowing you to:

- Keep your fork synchronized with the original repository
- Submit pull requests from your fork to the original repository
- Work independently on your own copy without affecting the original

---

### üì• Clone the Fork

Next, you‚Äôll need to clone your forked repository to your local machine. Here‚Äôs how:

1. On your forked repository page, click the **Code** button.
2. Copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

4. Navigate into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd Palmr
   ```

---

### üîÑ Set up Base Branch

Before making changes, ensure your local repository is set up to track the `next` branch from the original Palmr repository. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Add the original Palmr repository as a remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr.git
   ```

2. Fetch the latest changes from the `next` branch:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream next
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your contribution based on `upstream/next`:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name upstream/next
   ```

### ‚úèÔ∏è Make Local Changes

Now you're ready to make your contributions! This could include:

- Fixing a bug
- Adding a new feature
- Improving documentation
- Writing tests
- Enhancing performance
- Adding translations
- Improving accessibility
- Refactoring code
- Adding examples
- Reporting issues

Make your changes in your local repository using your preferred code editor. Here are some tips for making changes:

1. **Follow the Style Guide**: Make sure your code follows the project's coding standards and style guidelines
2. **Test Your Changes**: Run tests locally to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
3. **Keep Changes Focused**: Make small, focused changes that address a single issue or feature
4. **Document Your Changes**: Add or update documentation as needed to explain your changes
5. **Review Your Work**: Double-check your changes before committing to ensure quality

Remember to regularly save your work and test your changes incrementally to catch any issues early in the development process.

### üìù Use Conventional Commits

Once you‚Äôve made your changes, commit them to your branch using **Conventional Commits**. Conventional Commits help maintain a clean and consistent commit history. Here‚Äôs how to format your commit messages:

**Commit Message Format:**  
`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Examples:**

- `feat: add user authentication`
- `fix(api): resolve null pointer exception`
- `docs: update README file`
- `chore: update dependencies`

**Steps to Commit:**

1. Stage your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Commit your changes with a properly formatted message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature for user profiles"
   ```

---

### üì§ Push Changes

After committing your changes, you'll need to push them to your forked repository on GitHub. This step synchronizes your local changes with your remote repository. Here's how to do it:

1. First, ensure your branch is up-to-date with any remote changes:

   ```bash
   git pull origin your-branch-name
   ```

2. Then push your commits to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

If this is the first time pushing this branch, you might need to set the upstream branch:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

If you encounter any errors while pushing:

- Make sure you have the correct permissions on your fork
- Verify your remote URL is correct using `git remote -v`
- Check if you need to authenticate with GitHub

---

### üîÄ Create Pull Request

Now that your changes are on GitHub, you can open a **Pull Request (PR)** to propose your changes to the `next` branch of the Palmr repository. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click the **Pull Request** button.
3. On the PR creation page:
   - Set the **base repository** to `kyantech/Palmr`.
   - Set the **base branch** to `next`.
   - Set the **head repository** to your forked repository.
   - Set the **compare branch** to your branch (`your-branch-name`).
4. Fill out the PR form with a clear title and description of your changes.
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.

### ‚è≥ Await Review

Once your PR is submitted, the maintainers will review your changes. They may provide feedback or request additional changes. During this process:

- **Monitor Your PR**: Keep an eye on GitHub notifications for any comments or requests
- **Be Responsive**: Try to address feedback promptly and professionally
- **Make Updates**: If changes are requested, update your branch and push the new commits
- **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification if needed
- **Be Patient**: The review process may take some time depending on maintainer availability

Remember that code review is a collaborative process aimed at ensuring code quality. Stay engaged and maintain open communication with the maintainers throughout the review process.
