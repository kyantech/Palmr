- Report issues
- Contribute to discussions
- Access sponsor-only content (if available)

### 🔍 Access the Repository

Once you're logged in, go to the Palmr. repository by clicking on this link: [https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr](https://github.com/kyantech/Palmr).

Alternatively, you can search for "Palmr" in the GitHub search bar and click on the repository owned by **Kyantech**.

You can also:

- Star the repository to show your support
- Watch it for updates
- Fork it if you want to contribute

### 💖 Click the Sponsor Button

On the Palmr repository page, you'll see a **Sponsor** button at the top right corner of the page. Click this button to proceed. The button is typically highlighted in a distinct color to make it easily visible.
